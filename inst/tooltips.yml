input_scrnaseq: "Upload SingleCellExperiment/Seurat data as an .rds file. Gene names should be in Gene Symbol format. 
                               If a dataset is too large (>1Gb), subsampling of cells is recommended. For some applications, 
                               filtering for protein coding-only genes may also increase the relevance of the markers suggested by Cytosel."


coldata_column: "Categories of interest must be created before using Cytosel. 
                      Heterogeneity of multiple categories can be optimized at once if multiple categories are important. 
                      Options include:
                      <li>Cell type if there are known cell types that can be annotated.</li>
                      <li>Cluster identity, if using clustering to use as a proxy for cell state / cell type.</li>
                      <li>Condition, if aiming to separate experimental conditions.</li>
                      <li>Timepoint, if aiming to separate distinct timepoints.</li>"

panel_size: "Number of markers permitted while optimizing category separation."

subsample_sce: "Subsampling the single cell data will speed up all aspects of analysis. Especially recommended for larger datasets."

marker_display: "Markers are currently selected based on differential expression from one cluster against all other clusters.
                <br></br>
                Colour denotes which category has significantly upregulated expression of the given marker, 
                as a heuristic aid for deciding which markers will need a direct replacement if removed.
                <br></br>
                A checkmark means that there is an Abcam antibody available for this target. The Antibody Explorer tab allows you to explore the options available from Abcam for each target."

marker_visualization: "<em>Recommended markers:</em> This marker list is optimized to capture heterogeneity of the scRNAseq data as best as possible based on the panel size. 
                      It cannot be edited and serves as a reminder of the recommended markers while the user is organizing their panel.
                      <br></br>
                      <em>Selected markers:</em> This marker list is initially the same as in the <em>Recommended markers</em>, but it is editable. 
                      When the program is refreshed, it will rerun using these markers.
                      <br></br>
                      <em>Scratch space:</em> A place to keep markers that are under consideration, but that won't be used in a particular rerun of the program. 
                      Intended as a workspace."

umap: "UMAP is a dimension reduction technique used for visualization of complex data. 
                          Comparison between the UMAP for all genes versus the UMAP for selected panel allows 
                          an intuitive sense of how well cluster separation is recapitulated with the smaller number of genes selected."

heatmap_display_options: "<em>Expression</em> displays the heatmap of each selected marker's expression across the categories. 
                         If you are building a panel for a protein-based assay from an RNAseq dataset, 
                         it is advisable to choose markers that are clearly positive/negative between categories, 
                         as distinguishing clusters based on scale of expression may not translate as well between RNA to protein.
                         <br> </br>
                         <em>Marker-marker correlation</em> displays a heatmap of all correlation between all selected markers. 
                         It is intended for the user to decide which markers are redundant, if trimming the panel is desirable or certain markers are not viable."

heatmap_expression_norm: "To properly visualize the expression of markers with lower transcript abundance, scaling by Z score is recommended."

gene_removal: "Select genes to remove based on correlation heatmap. Suggestions will be ordered by correlation score."

metrics: "These metrics are based on training a classifier on the reduced set to predict category. 
                          Overall score is balanced accuracy of this classifier, 
                          while the individual scores are the positive predictive value (PPV) for each cell type."

metrics_explanation: "Balanced accuracy = Sum of recall for each category / number of categories.
                                                              <br>Recall = TP / (TP + FN)</br>
                                                              <br>PPV = TP / TP + FP. It is important to be aware that not all categories were created equal, 
                                                              and this metric is generally going to be poorer for smaller categories (i.e.: categories with fewer cells).</br>"



alternative_markers: "Input a marker that you want to replace. The top markers most correlated to your input will be recommended as a replacement. 
                          You can search for any marker that is present in your uploaded scRNAseq data, including ones not currently present in your selected panel."
